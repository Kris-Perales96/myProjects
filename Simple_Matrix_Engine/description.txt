This project is a simple matrix engine, where it performs either an add, subtract, transpose, multiply, or scale
on two 4x4 matricies. The main components of the project are an execution unit, instruction memory, main memory, and an ALU.
The execution unit operates as a state machine which are:
-Fetch an instruction
-Decode the instruction
-Read from main memory the indicated (from the instruction) matrix 1
-Push matrix 1 to ALU
-Read from main memory the indicated (from the instruction) matrix 2
-Push matrix 2 to ALU
-Tell ALU to go and execute the operation indicated (from instruction)
-Wait for all done signal from ALU
-Write back to registers, which in this case since I had the registers within the main memory is the same as writing to main memory
-Continue process until stop instruction is reached
